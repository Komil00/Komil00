👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile.

✍️ I am a 23-year-old professional programmer with expertise in both backend development and DevOps. I have successfully contributed to several projects, showcasing my skills and commitment to excellence.

🇺🇿 Currently, I hold positions as a DevOps Engineer at HamkorBank and a Backend Developer at Docsie.io, further honing my technical capabilities.
